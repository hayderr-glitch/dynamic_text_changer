# Dynamic Text Changer

A simple Flutter application that demonstrates real-time UI updates. As you type into the text field, the text below it updates instantly. This project serves as a great example of using a `StatefulWidget` to manage and reflect UI changes based on user input.

## Features

- **Real-time Updates**: The display text changes character-by-character as the user types into the `TextField`.
- **State Management**: A basic but clear example of using `StatefulWidget` and `setState` to manage UI state.
- **Simple & Clean UI**: A focused interface built with Material Design widgets, including a `TextField` for input and a `Text` widget for output.

## Preview

The application displays a title "Dynamic Text Changer", a text input field with a label, and a text area below it. When a user types into the input field, the text below dynamically updates to mirror the input.
